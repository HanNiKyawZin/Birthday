# 🎂 Birthday Wishes Book

An interactive **birthday wishes book** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It opens like a real book, flips through pages with animations, and includes floating hearts and birthday-themed visuals.  
This project was created as a personal gift — simple, creative, and heartfelt ❤️.

## 🧠 About the Project

I wanted to create a **unique digital birthday greeting** instead of a simple message.  
Using only front-end web technologies, I built this interactive book that looks and feels alive — pages flip, hearts float, and every page carries a message.  
It’s fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

1. **Started with an empty HTML file (`index.html`)**  
   I structured the book layout using `<div>` elements for the cover, pages, and navigation buttons.

2. **Added inline CSS for styling and responsiveness**  
   - Used **Google Fonts**: *Dancing Script*, *Playfair Display*, and *Montserrat*.  
   - Created a 3D book effect using `transform`, `perspective`, and `backface-visibility`.  
   - Added custom animations for the candle flame and floating hearts.  
   - Designed it to scale across different screen sizes using **media queries**.

3. **Added JavaScript for interactivity**  
   - Open and close the book cover (`rotateY` animation).  
   - Flip through each page using **Next** and **Previous** buttons.  
   - Randomly generate and animate hearts in the background.  
   - Managed page navigation logic with an array of paired pages.

4. **Tested it on multiple devices**  
   Ensured it worked smoothly on both PC and mobile browsers, adjusting font sizes and layout for smaller screens.

5. **Deployed to Netlify**  
   - I uploaded the `index.html` file directly.  
   - Netlify automatically hosted it and generated a live URL:
